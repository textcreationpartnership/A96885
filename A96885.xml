            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Con≈øidering, we ≈øay, all this we have done as you ≈øee, de≈øiring heartily, it may be a word well Timed, ≈øpoken in ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and ≈øet as upon the Wheel, Prov. 15. 23. 25. 11. 12. It is not proper for us now to Charge or to Coun≈øel, But wo to that man that will not hear the Charge of the Lord, and Coun≈øel from his mouth, for ≈øo ≈øaith the Lord. Therfore indeed of that wo let us pray That we may hear this charged upon us, by truely learned and Godly Mini≈øters as deeply as Paul chargeth Timothy upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 1. 5. 2. 11. <q rend="margDblQuotes">we charge you before God,

            <p>Then ≈øecondly, that we hearken what God ≈øaith by the ≈øaid Me≈ø≈øengers of the Churches and glory of Chri≈øt, and as dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be followers of them, as they follow Chri≈øt, and tho≈øe truely called Chri≈øtians, who thorow faith and patience inherit the promi≈øes.

He that rules over men ≈øhould be ju≈øt, and command in the Lord; But be that at his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril. Look we well to this, that we obey in the Lord. The greate≈øt Rulers in the world then much more our petty Rulers in our Towns (we will go no higher, that we may not out compa≈øs our knowledge) O how cro≈ø≈øe and contrary they are, and as they are they run, ≈øome of them clean cro≈ø≈øe to that

               <p>It is not always ≈øafe to do what we read the Lord did, though we may urge him for our example. Our Lord went over the
